# PRO vs free version

FPJS PRO was started in the beginning of 2019 when the [creator](https://github.com/Valve) of [FingerprintJS](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs) and [FingerprintJS 2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2) took feedback from existing open source users to implement a new professional version. FingerprintJS 2 project was started in 2015 and was based on FingerprintJS, that was itself created in 2012. These projects are used by thousands of companies on traffic scale of billions of users.  
PRO version is a commercially developed platform for fraud detection, anonymous user identification, bot detection and traffic analysis.

### **Security**

**Free:** generates the fingerprints directly in the browser, which makes it vulnerable to spoofing and reverse engineering.

**PRO:** processes all the information server-side and transmits it securely to you servers using server-to-server APIs. Information is never exposed in the browser, which makes it much harder to tamper with. All the information that is collected is never shared with 3rd parties. The safety of your data is our priority.

### **SLA**

**Free:** provides no SLA or any guarantees.

**PRO:** provides a 99.9% uptime/availability monthly SLA.

### **Support**

**Free:** only Github issues/questions with no response time guarantee.

**PRO:** provides a guaranteed response in 8 hours on weekdays; 48 hours or less on weekends or holidays.  
Dedicated support options are available on request.
