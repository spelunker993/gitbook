Nothing in the Agreement or this DPA shall prevent FingerprintJS from using or sharing any data that FingerprintJS would otherwise collect and process independently of Customer's use of the Services.

**2.3 Customer Obligations.** Customer agrees that \(i\) it shall comply with its obligations as a Controller under Data Protection Laws in respect of its processing of Personal Data and any processing instructions it issues to FingerprintJS; and \(ii\) it has provided notice and obtained \(or shall obtain\) all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for FingerprintJS to process Personal Data and provide the Services pursuant to the Agreement and this DPA.

**2.6 Our Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement \(including this DPA\), Customer acknowledges that FingerprintJS shall have a right to use and disclose data relating to and/or obtained in connection with the operation, support and/or use of the Services for its legitimate business purposes, such as billing, account management, technical support, product development and sales and marketing.

**3.2 Sub-processor Obligations.** FingerprintJS shall: \(i\) enter into a written agreement with the Sub-processor imposing data protection terms that require the Sub-processor to protect the Personal Data to the standard required by Data Protection Laws; and \(ii\) remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Sub-processor that cause FingerprintJS to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

**3.3 Changes to Sub-processors.** FingerprintJS shall provide Customer reasonable advance notice \(for which email shall suffice\) if it adds or removes Sub-processors.

**3.4 Objection to Sub-processors.** Customer may object in writing to FingerprintJS' appointment of a new Sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection by notifying FingerprintJS promptly in writing within five \(5\) calendar days of receipt of FingerprintJS' notice in accordance with Section 3.3. Such notice shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving commercially reasonable resolution.

### 7. Return or Deletion of Data

**7.1** Upon deactivation of the Services, all Personal Data shall be deleted, save that this requirement shall not apply to the extent FingerprintJS is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or to Personal Data it has archived on back-up systems, which such Personal Data FingerprintJS shall securely isolate and protect from any further processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.

### 8. Cooperation

**8.1** To the extent that Customer is unable to independently access the relevant Personal Data within the Services, FingerprintJS shall \(at Customer's expense\) taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable cooperation to assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in so far as is possible, to respond to any requests from individuals or applicable data protection authorities relating to the processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. In the event that any such request is made directly to FingerprintJS , FingerprintJS shall not respond to such communication directly without Customer's prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If FingerprintJS is required to respond to such a request, FingerprintJS shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.

**8.2** To the extent FingerprintJS is required under Data Protection Law, FingerprintJS shall \(at Customer's expense\) provide reasonably requested information regarding FingerprintJS processing of Personal Data under the Agreement to enable the Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by law.
