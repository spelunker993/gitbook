# Incognito / private mode detection

FPJS pro analyzes every page view and detects if it was made in incognito mode.   
These browsers are supported:

* Safari \(macOS / iOS\)
* Chrome \(Windows / macOS / iOS / Android / Linux\)
* Samsung Browser \(Android\)
* Firefox \(Windows / macOS / iOS / Android / Linux\)
* IE 10 \(WIndows\)
* IE 11 \(Windows\)
* Mobile IE \(Windows Phone\)
* Edge \(Windows\)

The information about incognito mode is included both in [API](server-api.md) and [Webhook](webhooks.md) responses.
