# User identification / fraud detection

Pro version is a platform that stores  page view events, identifies bots, performs the analysis of your visitors and provides an API to query that information. The goal of the PRO version is to provide businesses with a reliable and trustworthy service to identify website visitors and their activity.  
  
Every visitor to your website is assigned a permanent `visitorID` identifier. This identifier acts as a user\_id that you can use in your system.   
The `visitorID` value is calculated with latest fingerprinting technology and machine learning algorithms to identify when people are trying change their identity via proxies or other techniques.  
  
Once you have obtained a `visitorID` value, you can use it to perform fraud detection. Query  visitor information using our [API](server-api.md),  inspect visit history to get an idea if current activity is fraudulent or poses a threat to your website. It also can be used to get the probability of visitors being bots, geolocation \(based on IP\) and other types of useful information.
