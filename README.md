# Introduction

## FPJS PRO is the ultimate fraud detection API for your business

FPJS PRO is a combination of a JS agent that runs in the browser and a server-side storage and API system that securely identifies visitors and stores all the information you need to detect fraud. 

### How it works

To integrate FPJS PRO with your website, you need to add a JS snippet to your webpages.   
Once the snippet is added, you will start receiving the identification information via webhooks \(on your servers\) or callbacks \(in the browser\). The format of identification messages is explained in [webhooks section.](webhooks.md) Webhooks are delivered to your servers immediately after a page view. It's also possible to query visitor information later using the [API](server-api.md). 

### JS agent

FPJS PRO does not calculate a fingerprint in the browser. Instead, it uses a lightweight  JavaScript agent that collects multiple device signals and sends them to our servers. This helps prevent reverse engineering and spoofing of an identifier by advanced bots. The agent is hosted at edge locations around the world. It is only 8KB in size and always 20 ms away from your users.

### Server-side identification system

It provides a platform that  processes and stores  page view information to identify your website anonymous visitors. It is currently available in 2 regions: US east \(N.Virginia\) and EU central \(Frankfurt\). It also provides many helpful features that are explained in more detail on dedicated documentation pages.

### Business scenarios

**Catch bots trying to automatically input many usernames and passwords into your login forms.**  
Every visitor gets their unique `visitorID` value, which is calculated from multiple browser and device signals, including fingerprints. You can use that value to see if current visitor is a bot and when they had visited your website before.

**Confirm that someone buying an item is not the same user as someone a week ago that purchased an item with a stolen credit card. This time they think that with a different email address and IP you wonâ€™t catch them, but we know they have the same visitorID.**  
You can tag every visitor with custom data to be able to identify them later. You can also tell us \(through an API call\) that this visitor is a bad actor and be alerted when this visitor opens your website in the future.

**Catch users submitting fake forms and fake clicks.**  
Identify such users with a `visitorID`. Tag them and be alerted when they visit you again. 

### Usage examples

{% hint style="info" %}
These examples can help you get started quickly. For full information, visit the [JS agent documentation.](js-agent.md) If you would like to play with the FPJS PRO, send an email request for sandbox access. Sandbox is free to use, but is not suitable for production environment.
{% endhint %}

You should add the snippet to your `<head/>` tag and configure the agent with `fp('config'...` calls.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're testing from EU, add this configuration line:
{% endhint %}

```javascript
// this will use the EU central (Frankfurt) region
fp('config', 'region', 'eu');
```

#### Automatic sending of data on every page load:

```markup
<head>
 <script>
    window.fpLayer = window.fpLayer || [];
    function fp() { fpLayer.push(arguments); }
    fp('config', 'client', 'your-token');
    fp('config', 'autoSend', true);
  </script>
  <script async src="https://cdn.fpjs.io/@2/fp.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
..
</body>
```

#### Sending data on demand or on user actions:

```markup
<head>
  <script>
    window.fpLayer = window.fpLayer || [];
    function fp() { fpLayer.push(arguments); }
    fp('config', 'client', 'your-token');
  </script>
  <script async src="https://cdn.fpjs.io/@2/fp.js"></script>
</head>


<body>
  <button id="login-btn">Sign up</button>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("login-btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
      FP.send().then(function (res) {
        console.log(res);
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
```

#### Sending data on page load and getting results back

```markup
<head>
  <script>
    window.fpLayer = window.fpLayer || [];
    function fp() { fpLayer.push(arguments); }
    fp('config', 'client', 'your-token');
    fp('config', 'loaded', function (fp) {
      fp.send().then(function (data) {
        console.log(data);
      })
    });
  </script>
  <script async src="https://cdn.fpjs.io/@2/fp.js"></script>
</head>
```

#### Sending data and getting the results back on user actions

```markup
<head>
  <script>
    window.fpLayer = window.fpLayer || [];
    function fp() { fpLayer.push(arguments); }
    fp('config', 'client', 'your-token');
  </script>
  <script async src="https://cdn.fpjs.io/@2/fp.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <button id="login-btn">Sign up</button>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("login-btn").addEventListener("click", function () {
      FP.send().then(function (res) {
        console.log(res);
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
```
