# What is FPJS PRO

## The ultimate fraud detection API for your business

FPJS PRO is a combination of a client-side agent that runs in the browser and a server-side API that securely transmits all the information you need to detect unusual behavior. 

Identify malicious users, bots and other bad actors more effectively than ever before. Use our decision engine or incorporate the data we provide you into your own system.

## Client-side agent

FPJS PRO does not calculate a fingerprint in the browser. Instead, it uses a lightweight and fast JavaScript agent that collects several device signals and securely sends them to our servers. This helps prevent reverse engineering and spoofing of a fingerprint by more advanced bots. The agent is hosted at edge locations around the world. It is only 8KB in size and always 20 ms away from your users.

## Server-side identification API

Integrate with our APIs to receive identification events on your backend or get instant notifications about suspicious events. Data is never exposed in the browser. Identification information is transmitted securely to your servers.

## Usage examples

* **Catch bots trying to automatically input many usernames and passwords into your login forms.**
* **Confirm that someone buying an item is not the same user as someone a week ago that purchase an item with a stolen credit card. This time they think that with a different email address and IP you wonâ€™t catch them, but we know they have the same fingerprint.**
* **Catch users submitting fake forms and fake clicks.**
* **Track any kind of unusual behavior patterns before it becomes a problem.**
* **Catch bots trying to scrape all of your valuable information.**
